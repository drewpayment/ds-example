						After consenting to receive your W-2 online, you can obtain a paper copy of your Form W-2 by printing a copy from this Employee Self Service system.  In order to view and print your Form W-2, you must have access to a computer that supports viewing and printing of PDFs, and have an operable printer setup to work with the computer.
						</p>
						<p>
						Additionally, you can request a paper copy of your Form W-2 from your Payroll Department.  This request will not constitute a withdrawal of consent to receive your W-2 online through this Employee Self Service system.
						</p>
						<p>
						If you wish to withdraw your consent to receive your W-2 online, you must click the "Withdrawal of Consent" button.  Withdrawing your consent becomes effective immediately through the software, but does not apply to a W-2 that was furnished electronically before the due date on which the withdrawal of consent occurred.  Information about your withdrawal of your consent through this system will be made available to your Company Administrator which they will be able to confirm prior to the release of any future Form W-2s.
						</p>
						<p>
						Access to your electronic W-2 will remain on this Employee Self Service system at least through October 15th for the year following the calendar year to which the Form W-2 relates (or on the first business day after October 15, if October 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday).  However, access to your Electronic W-2s through this Employee Self Service system will cease upon termination of employment, unless your Company Administrator provides access to this system after termination of employment.  Additionally, if your employer terminates services with Dominion Systems, access to your electronic Form W-2 will cease through this Employee Self Service system.
						</p>
						<p>
						You agree to notify the Payroll Department or update this Employee Self Service system if any e-mail, address, or phone number changes have occurred since the issuance of your previous years' W-2.
						<br/>Your employer is responsible for notifying you of any changes to their contact information.
						</p>
						<p>
						By accepting this agreement, you acknowledge that the electronic version of the Form W-2 meets the IRS requirements for a substitute form, and that you will use this Employee Self Service system to review and print your Form W-2.  Additionally, you can review and save your electronic Form W-2 to your own computer hardware.
						</p>
						<p>
						You acknowledge that a paper copy of Form W-2 may be required to be printed and attached to a Federal, State, or local income tax return.
						</p>
						<p>By not accepting the above agreement, you agree to receive a paper copy of your Form W-2 from the Payroll Department by hand delivery or U.S. mail.</p>
