# Standards

## Quick Rules for UI

**Preventing Errors and Frustration**
1. Validation is handled as much as possible client-side.
2. Required fields use proper required validation. They turn red when incorrect and a message describing the rule is displayed.
3. Optional fields are marked as optional by the field label or section title
4. input content validation is used when necessary
  1. Masks
  2. Regex
  3. Ect.
5. Success messages are shown when save is successful.
6. Deleting or removing data has a confirm message attached.
7. Change track is added to the page
  1. Angular - TODO
  2. AngularJS - https://www.notion.so/dominionsystems/ds-beforeunload-1cce8b957d364c2c9affa997e17f83a2
  3. Legacy - https://www.notion.so/dominionsystems/Change-Tracking-3e7599d5132948949409c1dca4e9d440
8. Pages break gracefully when the browser size shrinks.

## Permissions
If the user doesn't have permission to see a page, hide the mene items. If the user enters a URL to a page they do not have access to, redirect them to logout.

## Layout Breakpoints
The site layout will respond once device width reaches a breakpoint, improving usability. Our foundational grid integrates these breakpoints, and most custom styles incorporate them in.

```
  xs: 0,
  sm: 576px,
  md: 768px,
  lg: 992px,
  xl: 1200px
```

## Running the Doc Site Locally
New and rewritten features are done on seperate branches and may not be merged into `Docs | Default`. In order to see the UI, You'll have to run the doc site locally.

1. In a terminal pointed to your local **WebCore** folder run `npm run serve:ds-docs`
2. Go to http://localhost:4200/ to see docs
