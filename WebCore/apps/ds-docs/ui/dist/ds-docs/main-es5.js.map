align fields that don't have a label but need to be inline. Use `inline-*-control` where * is the same as the breakpoint used in the row layout. \\r\\n  In this example, `md` is used so the class would be `inline-md-control`.\\r\\n</markdown>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"button-bar\\\">\\r\\n  <button class=\\\"btn btn-icon\\\" (click)=\\\"toggleAlignment = !toggleAlignment\\\">\\r\\n    <mat-icon>code</mat-icon>\\r\\n    View Code\\r\\n  </button>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"example-block\\\" [class.open]=\\\"toggleAlignment\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"ui\\\">\\r\\n    <ds-alignment></ds-alignment>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"example\\\">\\r\\n      <markdown src=\\\"app/ds-components/layouts/alignment/alignment.component.html\\\"></markdown>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>\\r\\n    ## Add scroll to column based on other columns's height \\r\\n    The card that has `.match-height` declared will take the height of the other column in the row.

If column breakpoints are being used, that breakpoint needs to be added here.\\r\\n  </markdown>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"button-bar\\\">\\r\\n    <button class=\\\"btn btn-icon\\\"

leave the page they are prompted to confirm leaving with unsaved changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow are the ways to apply change tracking within app.\\r\\n</markdown>\\r\\n\\r\\n<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>\\r\\n# Angular (ngx)\\r\\n</markdown>\\r\\n\\r\\n<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>\\r\\n## Template Driven Forms\\r\\nIn Angular [template-driven forms](https://angular.io/guide/forms) add the `dsTrackFormChanges` directive to the `form` element with the `#myForm=ngForm` declaration.\\r\\nWhen any form control is [dirty](https://angular.io/api/forms/AbstractControl#dirty) and the overall form is not [submitted](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgForm#onsubmit) \\r\\nthe user will be prompted if they attempt to leave the page.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse the `ngForm`'s `resetForm()` method to reset its `dirty` and `submitted` values to a pristine state.  For example, use `resetForm()` after a successful save so the user\\r\\nwill no longer be prompted if they attempt to navigate away from the page.\\r\\n</markdown>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"button-bar\\\">\\r\\n    <button class=\\\"btn btn-icon\\\" (click)=\\\"toggle1 = !toggle1\\\">\\r\\n        <i class=\\\"material-icons\\\">code</i>\\r\\n        View Code\\r\\n    </button>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"example-block\\\" [class.open]=\\\"toggle1\\\">\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"ui mb-4\\\">\\r\\n        <div class=\\\"overflow-list\\\">\\r\\n          <ds-template-form-change-track></ds-template-form-change-track>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <markdown [src]=\\\"'app/forms/change-track/template-form-change-track/template-form-change-track.component.html'\\\" ngPreserveWhitespaces>\\r\\n    </markdown>\\r\\n    <markdown [src]=\\\"'app/forms/change-track/template-form-change-track/template-form-change-track.component.ts'\\\" ngPreserveWhitespaces>\\r\\n    </markdown>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>\\r\\n## Reactive Forms\\r\\nIn Angular [reactive forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms) add the `dsTrackFormChanges` directive to the element containing the form's `[formGroup]`.\\r\\n`dsTrackFormChanges` will monitor the `dirty` state of the form.  In addition, you can also bind a custom `[submitted]='myCustomSubmitted'` variable to track \\r\\nif the form has been submitted or not.  Similar to template-driven forms then, when any form control is [dirty](https://angular.io/api/forms/AbstractControl#dirty) \\r\\nand the overall form is not `[submitted]` the user will be prompted if they attempt to leave the page.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse a `FormGroup`'s [`reset()`](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormGroup#reset) method to reset the form to a pristine state (usually after save or cancel).\\r\\n</markdown>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\\"button-bar\\\">\\r\\n    <button class=\\\"btn btn-icon\\\" (click)=\\\"toggle2 = !toggle2\\\">\\r\\n        <i class=\\\"material-icons\\\">code</i>\\r\\n        View Code\\r\\n    </button>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"example-block\\\" [class.open]=\\\"toggle2\\\">\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"ui mb-4\\\">\\r\\n      <div class=\\\"overflow-list\\\">\\r\\n        <ds-reactive-form-change-track></ds-reactive-form-change-track>\\r\\n      </div>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <markdown [src]=\\\"'app/forms/change-track/reactive-form-change-track/reactive-form-change-track.component.html'\\\" ngPreserveWhitespaces>\\r\\n    </markdown>\\r\\n    <markdown [src]=\\\"'app/forms/change-track/reactive-form-change-track/reactive-form-change-track.component.ts'\\\" ngPreserveWhitespaces>\\r\\n    </markdown>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>\\r\\n## Custom Change Logic \\r\\nFinally, you can also apply change tracking without forms using the `dsTrackChanges` directive along with the `[hasChanges]` attribute.  \\r\\nThis allows any custom logic to be applied to trigger a \\\"change\\\".
